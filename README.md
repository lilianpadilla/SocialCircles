# Social Circles
A semester long project for Trinity University's Software Engineering Course.

## Overview
Social Circles is a free online game where users can exercise their emotional intelligence in a fun, colorful and competitive environment. The goal is to not only maximize a social group's happiness through intuition and quick decision-making, but to maximize your total score. 

### How to Play
There are three "Social Circles," each with three characters in each circle. Once you click on a circle, you are presented with three possible actions: Give Compliment, Offer Help, and Invite to Event. These actions can positively or negatively impact your "Happiness Score," depending on what characters are within each circle. 

Every user has the advantage of viewing what each character likes and dislikes using the Characters Description page to help choose the right action to take. However, each time you click on a particular circle with a desired action--e.g. Social Circle #1, Offer Help-- the characters will randomize! 

Choose wisely, and **have fun!**
